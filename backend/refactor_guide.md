 # Modular & Scalable Backend Refactor Guide

 This document outlines a proposed project structure and step-by-step refactoring plan to transition from a monolithic R&D proof‑of‑concept backend to a modular, scalable architecture. The goal is to extract cohesive services (chat, memory, audio, video, RAG/vector retrieval, speech recognition, and stats) while minimizing disruption and avoiding massive, complex refactoring.

 ## 2. Services Overview
 - **chat**: Core chat orchestration, multi‑agent workflow, tone/style control.
 - **memory**: Persistent conversation context, embeddings store, caching.
 - **audio**: Real‑time audio streaming, provider abstraction (e.g., OpenAI, alternatives).
 - **video**: Video ingestion and processing (future feature).
 - **rag**: Query and retrieval logic for RAG (vector store lookups).
 - **vector**: Document chunking and ingestion pipelines for managing the vector store.
 - **voice_commands**: Voice commands, turn detection, and speech-to-text processing.
 - **stats**: Metrics collection, logging, analytics dashboards.

 ## 3. Refactoring Plan (Step‑by‑Step)
 Follow these phases sequentially. Each phase focuses on one service or cross‑cutting concern to limit scope and simplify integration.

 ### Phase 0: Scaffolding & Configuration
 1. Create the top‑level directories and `__init__.py` files as shown above.
 2. Move existing `config.py`, `runtime_config.py`, and `openaiconfig.py` into `config/`.
 3. Create `scripts/` and relocate `init-db/`, `test-rag.sh`, and other utility scripts there.
 4. Update import paths in `main.py`, `dashboard_integration.py`, and other entry points.

 ### Phase 1: Routing Layer Extraction
 1. In `routes/`, create stub route files for each service (see structure above).
2. Replace `realtime_chat.py` with `chat_routes.py`, `voice_commands_routes.py`, and `audio_routes.py` that import from the new service modules.
 3. Refactor `main.py` to `include_router` for each service router.
 4. Run the app and ensure endpoints return minimal responses or placeholders.

 ### Phase 2: Chat Service Migration
 1. Identify chat‑orchestration functions in `routes/realtime_chat.py`.
 2. Move them into `chat/orchestrator.py` and split agent logic under `chat/agents/`.
 3. Wire up `chat/api.py` to expose the chat endpoints.
 4. Update `routes/chat_routes.py` imports and calls accordingly.
 5. Test chat endpoints end‑to‑end.

### Phase 3: Voice Commands & Audio
1. Locate voice‑to‑text, turn detection, and voice command logic in `orchestrator.py` and `realtime_client.py`.
2. Extract speech recognition into `voice_commands/recognizer.py` and command detection into `voice_commands/commands.py`.
3. Extract streaming logic into `audio/streaming.py` and provider abstraction in `audio/provider.py`.
4. Connect `voice_commands_routes.py` and `audio_routes.py` to the new modules.
5. Validate audio, speech, and voice command workflows with sample audio.

 ### Phase 4: Memory Service
 1. Identify in‑memory or database context code in `memory/` or in `routes` files.
 2. Consolidate that logic under `memory/client.py` and `memory/models.py`.
 3. Update `memory_routes.py` to call into the new memory client.
 4. Run memory‑related endpoints/tests to verify persistence.

 ### Phase 5: RAG/Vector Service
 1. Move the retrieval logic file from `vector/rag.py` into `rag/retriever.py`.
 2. Keep chunking and ingestion scripts under `vector/ingest/` for future document ingestion.
 3. Update `rag_routes.py` to expose retrieval (and ingestion, if desired) endpoints.
 4. Validate retrieval workflows (e.g., run `test-rag.sh` against new routes).

 ### Phase 6: Stats & Monitoring
 1. Extract analytics and stats‑collection code from `stats/` and any mixed routes.
 2. Implement `stats/collector.py` to centralize metric logging.
 3. Update `stats_routes.py` to provide stats endpoints.
 4. Verify dashboard and stats APIs for expected metrics.

 ### Phase 7: Video Service (Future)
 1. Create `video/processor.py` with basic scaffolding.
 2. Add stub endpoints in `video_routes.py`.
 3. Plan integration with front‑end and test with dummy video payloads.

 ## 4. Cleanup & Next Steps
 - Remove `routes/realtime_chat.py` once all functionality is migrated.
 - Remove any unused imports and files.
 - Run a full test cycle and update CI/CD pipelines if needed.
 - Document service‑specific configuration in `config/README.md` (optional).
 - Consider adding automated code formatting and type checks (e.g., `pre‑commit`, `mypy`).
