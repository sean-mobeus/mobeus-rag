He was interested in understanding time zones, specifically UTC and Indonesian time, due to his work requirements. Sean asked about the 24/7 availability of Mobeus's TeleHumans (Teles) during business hours for his European campaign. The assistant confirmed their constant availability. Sean also inquired about the compatibility of operating systems with Mobeus's technology, though declined further assistance in connecting with a Mobeus representative. Sean communicated primarily in English, but also demonstrated an interest in speaking Vietnamese, which the assistant acknowledged. There were no actionable items or commitments made during the conversation.", "chars_before": 3100, "chars_after": 0, "interactions_preserved": 10, "timestamp": "2025-05-30 01:08", "trigger_reason": "auto_disconnect"}}
